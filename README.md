# Linux-Basic-To-Advanced
Welcome to the Linux-Basic-To-Advanced! This project is designed to help users learn Linux from the basics to advanced topics, covering everything from command-line operations to system administration and scripting.
# Linux Fundamentals
# Kernel
The kernel is a core component of a computer operating system, providing complete control over system resources. It facilitates interactions between hardware and software components, allocating resources and managing processes efficiently.

# RAM (Random Access Memory)
RAM is used to store program instructions and data temporarily. The kernel manages memory allocation, ensuring that each process receives the necessary memory resources for execution.

# Shell
The shell is an interface that allows users to interact with the Linux system through commands. It interprets user commands and executes them, serving as a bridge between users and the operating system.

# Types of Shells
# Bash Shell (Bourne Again Shell): 
Developed for the GNU project, it is the default standard shell in most Linux distributions. The prompt character ($) indicates its usage.

# Bourne Shell: 
The original Unix shell, written by Bill Joy at UC Berkeley. It was the first shell to appear on Unix systems and is often installed as /bin/sh.

# Csh (C Shell): 
Known for its similarity to the C programming language syntax, it is preferred by some users, especially network administrators comfortable with C programming concepts. The prompt character (%) indicates its usage.

# Linux File System Hierarchy (FHS)
The File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and organization of files in a Linux system. It ensures consistency across distributions and provides a standardized framework for file placement.

# Key Directories
**/bin:** Contains essential commands accessible to both system administrators and regular users.

**/boot:** Stores files required for the boot process, including the kernel and bootloader configurations.

**/dev:** Houses device files representing hardware devices, facilitating communication between the operating system and hardware components.

**/etc:** Stores system-wide configuration files, including network settings, user configurations, and application settings.

**/home:** Contains user home directories, providing storage for user-specific files, settings, and configurations.

**/lib:** Contains shared library files necessary for booting the system and executing commands in the root file system.

**/media:** Acts as a mount point for removable media devices such as USB drives and optical discs.

**/mnt:** Provides a temporary mount point for file systems, allowing administrators to mount external or temporary file systems as needed.

**/opt:** Typically used for optional software packages, providing a separate directory for additional applications not included in the core system.

**/root:** Home directory for the root user, the superuser with unrestricted access to system resources.

**/sbin:** Contains essential system administration utilities, often used for booting, recovery, and system repair tasks.

**/srv:** Stores site-specific data served by the system, such as website files or data accessible to network services.

**/tmp:** Houses temporary files used by programs and processes, with contents typically cleared on system reboot.

**/usr:** Contains shareable read-only data, including applications, libraries, and user-related files used by multiple users.

**/var:** Stores variable data files, including logs, administrative data, temporary files, and database files used by system processes and applications.
